# Bus-Ticket-Booking Project

Buses are the most frequently available and the most used vehicle for small distance trips
as well as very long distance trips. While its easy for the customer to take a bus and
travel from source to destination,its not easy for the bus agency owner to maintain the
details of all the buses,customers and employees. The bus agency owner has to make
sure that all the activities runs in perfect sync with each other.The Bus Ticket Booking
Management System will help the owner to run his business smoothly by helping the
owner in maintaining employee details, bus details, route details. In addition to this
the owner will also be able to keep track of the customer details as well as the ticket details in the office.
