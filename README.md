<h1>Bus-Ticket-Booking Project<h1>
<img src="https://github.com/GowthamPB/Bus-Ticket-Booking/blob/main/Dash-board.png">
<h2>Why?</h2> 
<p style="text-align:justify;"><div>Buses are the most frequently available and the most used vehicle for small distance trips as well as very long distance trips. While its easy for the customer to take a bus and travel from source to destination,its not easy for the bus agency owner to maintain the details of all the buses, customers and employees. The bus agency owner has to make sure that all the activities runs in perfect sync with each other.</div></p>

<h2>What?</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><div>The Bus Ticket Booking Management System will help the owner to run his business smoothly by helping the owner in maintaining employee details, bus details, route details. In addition to this the owner will also be able to keep track of the customer details as well as the ticket details in the office.</div></p>

 <h2>How?</h2>
The project uses:
  
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>PHP</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>What next?</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the future I hope to add a login page so that I can allow multiple users to interact with this website and also a payment gateway so that maintaining transaction details becomes much easier for the business.</p>
